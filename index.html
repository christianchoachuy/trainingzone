<p class="body">Our Mission</p>
<p class="content">The Training Zone web site is intended to increase revenue for Training Zone by promoting the services offered by the company and increasing new and repeat customers.</p>
<p class="body">Target Audience</p>
<p class="content">Local residents, mostly between the ages of 28 and 50 form the majority of our current audience (mature age job seekers), and this is who the site is aimed at.</p>
<p class="body">Success Evaluation</p>
<p class="content">Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including the new web site), so that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. At the end of this 3 month period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted and compared to the previous 3 months.<br><br><br><img src="index.jpg" width="85%" alt=""/></p>
<p id="footer">While we believe the best training is done face-to-face (with us!), here are some good web sites for you to do extra work:<br>
Business Philosophy from Jim Rohn: http://www.jimrohn.com/<br> 
Inspiring true performanceâ€¦ Zig Ziglar : http://www.zigziglar.com/<br>
